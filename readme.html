<p>This code was contributed by A Poleg-Polsky. These models provide a
comparison between processing of noisy inputs in dendritic subunits
  and whole-cell synaptic integration.

To run the NEURON model, compile the mod files and start with mosinit.hoc. If you need more

<p>Simulated cortical cells (pyramidal layer 2/3 or pyramidal layer 5)
are assumed to be innervated by inputs from a presynaptic population
that increases its firing rate when presented with a preferred
stimulus. In the focal synaptic distribution active synapses on the
postsynaptic cell are mapped to an individual dendritic branch in
layer 2/3 simulation or 5 branches in the case of a layer 5 cell. In
the global synaptic distribution all synapses are placed randomly
across the dendritic arbor.
</p>
<p>The simulation includes population noise, which modifies the number of
spikes elicited by each presynaptic cell. There are two main noise
structures in the simulation. The first noise samples from a Gaussian
distribution (noise intensity if set by Fano factor (variance/mean);
set by the 'stochastic noise' variable). The second noise structure
introduces classification errors. In the case of classification errors
(%) the stimulus is assumed to represent a binary choice
(preferred/null) and a small percentage of inputs respond to the
opposite stimulus. With classification errors (degrees, DS) the input
population is assumed to encode stimulus direction and the trial-trial
variability arises from shifts in the encoded direction. In this
scenario, the classification error represents the width of a normal
distribution of input directions that is sampled by the cells in the
population. In the case of only two possible directions, directional
classification errors are equivalent to the binary choice
classification errors.

a layer 2/3 cell  (Click "Layer 2/3") (black, soma; grey, active dendrite) during the
  preferred (left)  (Click "Preferred signal", "Init & Run") and null (right) stimuli (Click "Null signal", "Init & Run").
  Bottom, 10 superimposed
traces of responses to the preferred (left) and null (right) stimuli (You can use the graph pop-up menu -> "Keep Lines").

population (Stochastic noise was set to 1.5). Top, dendritic focal
stimulation, boron, global activation. Left - Preferred, right-null
stimuli. Note the errors in postsynaptic responses following dendritic
subunit activation that are evident from spiking to null and no
spiking to preferred stimuli.

<p>Figure 4: Same as Fig. 3 with classification errors (15%) produce
accurate responses in the dendritic units (top) but lead to
significant decrease in the number of action potentials elicited for
the preferred direction (bottom left) and some increase in the number
of spikes to the null stimulation (bottom, right) for global synaptic
distribution.</p>
